I essentially made a Terms and Conditions reader using the Google Gemini API. You can paste in some Terms and Conditions from YouTube, let's say, and it'll tell you a brief breakdown of the policies the site has. Gemini's API was really frustrating to use, and I almost scrapped my idea a few hours in.\n\nI leaked my API key towards the end of the challenge... that was really scary. I think Dr. Bart was talking about how people in other Hackathons exposed their API keys as well and warned us about it.\n\nIf you'd like to try out my site, here's the link: <https://edwinko-alt.github.io/Fine-Print-Buster/>\n\nI do hope it's still up. I ran into some CloudFlare issues when setting it up, but everything should work now.\n\nJust wait a few moments after hitting 'send' because it takes a while for everything to work.\n\nWow, I honestly can't believe that I won... I thought that there were some very impressive projects that were much more impressive and useful that what I made. Well, regardless, I now have an iPad to show for it. I'm really glad that I went.\n\nI wish I took pictures... I was supposed to, but working on the site took up so much of my time. I also wish I could've worked with someone else. That would have been a lot more fun.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nMy first post!\n\n## Introduction\n\nHi! I guess this is the first blog post, huh?
