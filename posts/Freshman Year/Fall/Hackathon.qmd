My first post!

## Introduction

Hi! I guess this is the first blog post, huh? I hope to journal about my college experience so that I can later on look back upon it. I was thinking of writing everyday, but I've realized that'll probably be very difficult. We'll see, I guess.

Anyways—the Honors Hackathon! I've never participated in a Hackathon before. The best I can compare it to is the Big Ideas Challenge me and my engineering group participated in yesterday and a game jam I took part of in 8th grade.

Speaking of the Big Ideas Challenge, we didn't win, but it was still really interesting to see what other people have created. I wish I took pictures.

I'll try to take pictures while I'm at the Hackathon though. I wonder what it's like... they don't tell you what to make, so it's simply up to you and your partner's imagination. Now that I think of it, I don't know many people who did sign up for the Hackathon. Ah well, maybe I'll try to rope someone into working with me. Two heads are better than one, after all.

I'm not very good at programming, but I hope to do somewhat well.

## Post Hackathon

You won't believe it, but I **WON**! I essentially made a Terms and Conditions reader using the Google Gemini API. You can paste in some Terms and Conditions from YouTube, let's say, and it'll tell you a brief breakdown of the policies the site has. Gemini's API was really frustrating to use, and I almost scrapped my idea a few hours in.

I leaked my API key towards the end of the challenge... that was really scary. I think Dr. Bart was talking about how people in other Hackathons exposed their API keys as well and warned us about it.

If you'd like to try out my site, here's the link: <https://edwinko-alt.github.io/Fine-Print-Buster/>

I do hope it's still up. I ran into some CloudFlare issues when setting it up, but everything should work now.

Just wait a few moments after hitting 'send' because it takes a while for everything to work.

Wow, I honestly can't believe that I won... I thought that there were some very impressive projects that were much more impressive and useful that what I made. Well, regardless, I now have an iPad to show for it. I'm really glad that I went.

I wish I took pictures... I was supposed to, but working on the site took up so much of my time. I also wish I could've worked with someone else. That would have been a lot more fun.
