My upcoming classes.

# Schedule

I'll be taking the following classes this upcoming semester:

-   CISC210 (Intro to Systems Programming)

-   CPEG202 (Intro to Digital Systems)

-   ELEG305 (Signals and Systems)

-   HONR290 (Honors Colloqium - Art of Interpretation)

-   MATH351 (Engineering Mathematics 1)

-   PHYS227 (Fundamentals of Physics Lab 1)

-   PHYS228 (Fundamentals of Physics Lab 2)

One might ask why I'm taking 7 classes next semester. Well, it's really only five, but the two labs just make it seem like a lot. Also, by doing this, I may be able to graduate a full year early.

I'm still not too sure what I would really like to do in the future (at least, career wise), so taking these classes will give me options in my final few semesters (either a masters degree, or a co-op). That's my logic at least.

I will definitely have to cut down my hours at work. Maybe I'll only work for four hours during the weekends. That should be sustainable, but I still do have to curb my procrastination.
