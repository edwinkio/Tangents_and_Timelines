My upcoming classes.

# Schedule

I'll be taking the following classes this upcoming semester:

-   CISC210 (Intro to Systems Programming)

-   CPEG202 (Intro to Digital Systems)

-   ELEG305 (Signals and Systems)

-   HONR290 (Honors Colloqium - Art of Interpretation)

-   MATH351 (Engineering Mathematics 1)

-   PHYS227 (Fundamentals of Physics Lab 1)

-   PHYS228 (Fundamentals of Physics Lab 2)

# Why?

One might ask why I'm taking 7 classes next semester. Well, it's really only five, but the two labs just make it seem like a lot. Also, by doing this, I may be able to graduate a full year early.

I'm still not too sure what I would really like to do in the future (at least, career wise), so taking these classes will give me options in my final few semesters. That's my logic at least.

I will definitely have to cut down my hours at work. Maybe I'll only work for four hours during the weekends. That should be sustainable, but I have to curb my procrastination.

# Rant

Textbooks and supplies are so expensive. Why do I have to pay over \$200 for a math textbook? And then for CPEG202, there's an FGPA board that costs like a hundred dollars. I regret not buying it on Black Friday. It was so much cheaper.

The ELEG305 textbook costs around \$50, but I managed to get it for free through the publisher's website.

I haven't even mentioned the HONR290 class' book costs. College is expensive.
